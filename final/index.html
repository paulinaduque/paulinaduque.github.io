<h1>Time to Talk About Sexual Assault In Sports</h1>
<p>Sexual harassment is defined as the unwanted excess of attention on the basis of sex, from there the offense can escalate to sexual assault, which is when the attention becomes physical and could even turn violent. Athletics often creates an ideal breeding ground for the sexual abuse and assault due to things like “locker-room talk”, toxic masculinity that perpretates the idea that expressing emotions is a sign of weakness, or “gray-areas” that appear when coaches provide hands-on assistance. Sports are a valued part of cultures and oftentimes hold sacred positions in that culture, leaving authority figures to turn a blind eye around potentially dangerous situations to avoid harming the reputation of the game, athlete, or coach instead of protecting its victims.</p>

<p>Athletes, and especially children, are vulnerable to these behaviors; including but not exclusive to sexual harassment, sexual assault, discimination, and sexual abuse. Because of society's value for sports, coaches are meant to play exemplary leadership roles and often serve as strong authority figures in a young athlete's life. A large scale study revealed that 29% of the undergraduate students ages 18-22 were sexually abused as a child athlete.  When such role models and authority figures perverse and abuse the trust between an athlete and their coach, athletes end up suffering the harmful consequences of that abuse.</p>

<p>Due to a these factors the prevalence of sexual assault and abuse is high in sports, and- like sexual abuse in most other situations perpetrated- by people in positions of power. It's the power held over the victim that leads to abuse going unreported or unnoticed. Whether it's not knowing who to turn to or fear that no one will believe them, fear that the individual did something to deserve the pain they’ve endured, or simply not knowing what to do or who to turn to, reports of abuse or assault get dismissed, ignored, taken too lightly, or go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Assault and abuse is often fostered by coaches, other athletes, and anyone with some form of power over another individual or group of individuals. A study of 159 sexual abuse cases found that 98% of the abusers in reported cases were coaches, teachers, or instructors, which is about 155 coaches or instructors out of 159 abused their atheletes in some mannar. Another 2016 study found that 17.2% of the females experienced childhood sexual abuse in athletics while the rate for boys was 10.2%. This same study found one in seven kids are victims to some form of sexual violence. These statistics should be more than unsettling and upsetting but repulsive and demanding of a solution.</p>

<p>Parents push their children into sports to socialize them, teach them discipline, promote their health and for all the other beneficial factors that sports as an activity permits. Despite the multitude positives provided to society by the sporting industry, it does not outshine the detrimental effects children can be exposed to as child athletes. The statistics and data available only shows a portion of the problem. It can't go unacknowledged that there are voices that go unheard, reports that go unfilled, and stories that go untold, some victims of abuse may never tell their story to anyone. It's critical to expose the horrors that kids can be exposed to if something doesn’t change. Sexual assault within athletics is an even larger issue as a whole, there have been too many victims, when will society finally listen to the victims, not just hear them.</p>
